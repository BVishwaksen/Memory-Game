### Instructions

The starter project given has some default HTML and CSS having static features i.e that does not react
to user inputs.
We have to convert this static project to a dynamic project that accepts user inputs.
This will require modifying the HTML file, but a little. The major changes have to be done in the
javascript file.
To get started, open js/app.js and start building the functionality of the app.
